Dry Skin Suggestions
</h1>

<body>
 

<p>If you have dry Skin:<br>
	-dry skin can also do with some extra moisturizing, just like oily skin, so you can try out oils but the best
	this to use are traditional miosturizers. Olay as well as Burt's bees have great miosturizers you can put on 
	before bed to wake up with hydrates skin<br>
	-use a toner after washing your face, Mario badescu has some great facial mists. I personally love the rose 
	water facial mist, it smells great and won't break the bank. <br
