Combination Skin Suggestions
</h1>

<body>
 
<p> If you have Combination Skin:<br>
	-any of the above products should work for you but combo skin is really just code for your ability to use 
	both oil and dry skin items<br>
	-luckily for you lots of youtubers and beauty bloggers have found a new way to use clay face masks, you 
	can put a clay mask on blemishes while using a moisterizing mask on dry patches. It's really about finding
	what works for you.
