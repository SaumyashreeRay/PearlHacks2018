Oily Skin suggestions

<p>
	If you have Oily Skin: <br>
	- Some people use oil instead of other moisturizers to combat their oily skin (I know it seems
	counter productive but people swear it works) some people use Jojoba Oil or Argon oil but most 
	just take their makeup off and moisturize with regular ol' coconut oil<br>
	-Use an oil control gentle Clenser. Sometimes your face gets more oily just because you are using 
	too harsh of a soap on your face. Try something like Cetaphil oil control for a more gentle clean.
