<p>
	If you have Oily Skin: <br>
	- Some people use oil instead of other moisturizers to combat their oily skin (I know it seems
	counter productive but people swear it works) some people use Jojoba Oil or Argon oil but most 
	just take their makeup off and moisturize with regular ol' coconut oil<br>
	-Use an oil control gentle Clenser. Sometimes your face gets more oily just because you are using 
	too harsh of a soap on your face. Try something like Cetaphil oil control for a more gentle clean.
</p>
<p>If you have dry Skin:<br>
	-dry skin can also do with some extra moisturizing, just like oily skin, so you can try out oils but the best
	this to use are traditional miosturizers. Olay as well as Burt's bees have great miosturizers you can put on 
	before bed to wake up with hydrates skin<br>
	-use a toner after washing your face, Mario badescu has some great facial mists. I personally love the rose 
	water facial mist, it smells great and won't break the bank. <br
	
</p>
<p> If you have Combination Skin:<br>
	-any of the above products should work for you but combo skin is really just code for your ability to use 
	both oil and dry skin items<br>
	-luckily for you lots of youtubers and beauty bloggers have found a new way to use clay face masks, you 
	can put a clay mask on blemishes while using a moisterizing mask on dry patches. It's really about finding
	what works for you.
