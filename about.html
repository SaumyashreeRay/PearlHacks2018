This website was created for the PearlHacks competition at UNC Chapel Hill. 
Two days prior UNC beat our rivals at Duke and we hit gold with the inspiration of a self care website.
Sometimes its great to to just relax and rush Franklin. Anyway, hope you like what we have and 
feel free to leave feedback below. (As long as you aren't repping the wrong color blue.)
